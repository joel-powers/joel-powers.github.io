<h2 id="from-out-of-left-field">From Out of Left Field</h2>

<p>When my wife and I were expecting our second child, it occurred to me that adding some extra income each month would be a good idea. I know, <em>huge</em> understatement. Extra income is never a bad idea, but when you’re expecting a baby, it can be more of a pressing issue. That’s even more true when you <a href="http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/city_result.jsp?country=United+States&amp;city=New+York%2C+NY">live in New York</a>. I’ll leave the details out for now, as there’s no reason anyone should feel sorry for a New Yorker.</p>

<p>To get back to the point, I was scrambling to come up with something I could do that would add significantly to our bottom line. I took a quick audit of my abilities and tried to match them to opportunities available in the five boroughs. That effort didn’t produce anything of real use. So I thought about doing something online.</p>

<p>At first, I decided to be a freelance photo retoucher. I watched a lot of <a href="http://www.lynda.com/">tutorials</a> and practiced a ton. When I felt like I had enough skill to attempt to make a business of it, I began looking at making a portfolio site. Knowing that I couldn’t afford a web designer, I started to read some tutorials. Then I found <a href="http://5by5.tv/bigwebshow">The Big Web Show</a> and <a href="http://shoptalkshow.com/">Shop Talk</a>. I started to read <a href="http://alistapart.com/">A List Apart</a> and <a href="https://css-tricks.com/">CSS Tricks</a>. I followed some people on Twitter (too many to list.) I expanded to design, taking some extension courses at NYU and adding more <a href="http://www.debbiemillman.com/designmatters/">podcasts</a>, <a href="http://designobserver.com/">blogs</a> and tutorials.</p>

<h2 id="just-build-websites">Just Build Websites!</h2>

<p>The whole thing snowballed until I found myself much more interested in making websites than I ever was in retouching. The moral of the story is: It’s a lot harder to make a website the right way than you’ll realize when you first arrive at the idea. Any good resources are spread around the Web (I capitalize it now) so you really have to be comfortable googling for what you need to know. If you find good lots of good information in one place, it will probably not be at a beginner’s level. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">Mozilla Developer Network</a> is an awesome resource, but it went over my head a little sometimes. CSS Tricks is just flat awesome.</p>

<p>So, what am I doing here? If there are already so many good places to get information, why should you read what I have to say? Well, it’s pretty simple. I’m of the mind that there are a lot of ways to learn things, and we all have our own particular ways in which we absorb things best. A ton of text can be great for some people, and completely incomprehensible to some others. I’d like to approach this subject a little differently and hopefully help you understand the more complicated stuff by presenting it in different ways; illustrating, diagramming and writing about it.</p>

<p>If I’m wrong about something, please file <a href="https://github.com/joel-powers/joel-powers.github.io/issues">issues</a> at the GitHub repo for this site or file a <a href="https://github.com/joel-powers/joel-powers.github.io/pulls">pull request</a>. I’d like to lower the barriers as much as I can.</p>
